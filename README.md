## AI Security Intelligence Layer for Autonomous Web3 Agents

## AI Security Control Layer for Autonomous Web3 Agents

Agentic Wallet Guardian v2 is an AI-native security middleware that enables autonomous agents to safely operate on blockchain.

Instead of relying on humans to approve every action, AI agents call Guardian before execution and receive a machine-readable security decision:


ALLOW
WARN
BLOCK

Guardian acts as an independent security intelligence layer between autonomous agents and blockchain execution.

# Problem

Autonomous AI agents are becoming capable of:

- controlling wallets
- executing transactions
- interacting with smart contracts
- managing digital assets

But autonomous execution creates a new security challenge:

> How can an AI agent verify that an action is safe before signing a blockchain transaction?

Existing security tools are designed mainly for human users.

Autonomous agents require a new security layer that can evaluate actions automatically before execution.

AI agents need machine-readable security decisions, not human approvals.

# Solution

Agentic Wallet Guardian provides an AI-native security layer between autonomous agents and blockchain execution.

Guardian acts as a security decision engine for AI agents, allowing them to evaluate risk autonomously before interacting with wallets, contracts, and blockchain protocols.

Before performing a transaction, an AI agent sends a security request to Guardian.

Guardian evaluates:

- wallet intelligence
- transaction context
- policy rules
- agent reputation
- security risks
- previous decisions

Then Guardian returns an explainable decision:

ALLOW
WARN
BLOCK

# Why Agentic Wallet Guardian

As AI agents become autonomous, they need their own security infrastructure.

Guardian allows agents to:

- evaluate blockchain actions before execution
- detect risky interactions
- apply security policies automatically
- learn from previous decisions
- operate without human approval for every transaction

Guardian is not a wallet scanner.

It is a security intelligence layer built for the agent economy.

# Core Features

## AI Agent Security Layer

Guardian is designed for autonomous AI agents.

Agents can request a security evaluation before executing blockchain actions.

The system provides machine-readable decisions:

ALLOW
WARN
BLOCK


## Wallet Intelligence

Guardian analyzes blockchain wallet context:

- wallet activity
- transaction history
- wallet age
- wallet profile
- security indicators


## Risk Fusion Engine

Multiple security dimensions are combined into one decision:

- wallet behavior
- transaction context
- security intelligence
- policy rules
- agent reputation
- data confidence


## Agent Reputation Engine

Guardian evaluates autonomous agent behavior over time.

Previous interactions influence future risk assessment.

Example:

Agent History:

ALLOW
ALLOW
WARN
BLOCK

↓

Risk adjustment


## Explainable Decision Engine

Every decision contains:

- trust score
- risk level
- detected signals
- reasoning
- limitations

Example:

Decision:
ALLOW_WITH_LIMITATIONS

Trust Score:
94/100

Positive:

Healthy wallet behavior
No major security threats detected

Unknown:

Approval data unavailable
Token data incomplete
